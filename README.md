# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
The Bank Loan Case Study project, aim is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that capable applicants are not rejected where company faces a challenge some customers who donâ€™t have a sufficient credit history take advantage of this and default on their loans.


A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately:  Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.
Utilizing Excel functions like COUNT, ISBLANK, and IF to identify missing data. Consider using functions like AVERAGE or MEDIAN for imputation or other appropriate methods available in Excel.
Creating a bar chart or column chart to visualize the proportion of missing values for each variable.

B. Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.
Utilizing Excel functions like QUARTILE, IQR, and conditional formatting to identify potential outliers. Consider applying thresholds or business rules to determine if the outliers are valid data points or require further investigation.
Creating box plots or scatter plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables and highlight the outliers.

C. Analyze Data Imbalance: Determining if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.
Utilizing Excel functions like COUNTIF and SUM to calculate the proportions of each class. Compare the class frequencies to assess data imbalance.
Creating a pie chart or bar chart to visualize the distribution of the target variable and highlight the class imbalance.

D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.
Utilizing Excel functions like COUNT, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and statistical functions for descriptive analysis. Utilize Excel features like filters, sorting, and pivot tables for segmented and bivariate analysis.
Creating histograms, bar charts, or box plots to visualize the distributions of variables. Create stacked bar charts or grouped bar charts to compare variable distributions across different scenarios. Create scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize the relationships between variables and the target variable.

E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
Utilizing Excel functions like CORREL to calculate correlation coefficients between variables and the target variable within each segment. Rank the correlations to identify the top indicators of loan default for each scenario.
Creating correlation matrices or heatmaps to visualize the correlations between variables within each segment. Highlight the top correlated variables for each scenario using different colors or shading.
